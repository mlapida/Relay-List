Relays are constantly changing. Currently, Relay List is reliant on users to report the status of, and submit, new relays. The easiest way to do so is by using the below buttons to create an issue. Alternatively, you can submit a pull request with the updated content. 

This site uses standard markdown, generated into a static site by [Retype](https://retype.com/). The source code is hosted on GitHub and the site is hosted on GitHub Pages. Clicking the edit button at the bottom of each page will take you to the corresponding markdown file in GitHub.
